# ecs

DATA oriented, *functional* entity component system.

## what?

Many games and simulations are built around object oriented classes and scene graphs.

Structuring leads to questions like:

> where does this particular piece of logic/state live?

There are certain bits of logic/state that cross-cut and don't fit cleanly in one place, and code and logic become entangled in various places in the graph.  

Not all relationships in a game/simulation are modeled appropriately with parent/child relationships which is why we get into these situations.


ECS is an alternative architecture:

* **E**ntities have 0 or more components / subject , object
* **C**omponents are pure data and have no behavior / predicate
 * утверждать
 * основывать на фактах
* **S**ystems have behavior but no data /

The entire ecs module here is about 100 lines of code, and offers an O(1) iterator at run time for querying for entities within systems.


## usage example

This is a minimal example of what you can do with `ecs`, illustrating how to declare
your entities, components, and systems.

Requires node version `12.17.1` or higher.

```javascript
import ECS      from 'ecs'
import Keyboard from './my/game/keyboard.js'
import clamp    from 'clamp'


// generates a new entity component system
const world = ECS.createWorld()


// set up the player
const PLAYER = ECS.createEntity(world)
ECS.addComponentToEntity(world, PLAYER, 'position', { x: 15, y: 23 })
ECS.addComponentToEntity(world, PLAYER, 'moveable', { dx: 0, dy: 0 })



// update entity velocity based on key pressed
function keyboardControlSystem (world) {
    // called each game loop
    const onUpdate = function (dt) {
        // get all of the entities in the world that pass the filter
        for (const entity of ECS.getEntities(world, [ 'moveable' ])) {
            // update the entity position according to what is pressed
            if (Keyboard.keyPressed('up'))
                entity.moveable.dy -= 1
            if (Keyboard.keyPressed('down'))
                entity.moveable.dy += 1
            if (Keyboard.keyPressed('left'))
                entity.moveable.dx -= 1
            if (Keyboard.keyPressed('right'))
                entity.moveable.dx += 1

           entity.moveable.dx = clamp(entity.moveable.dx, -10, 10)
           entity.moveable.dy = clamp(entity.moveable.dy, -10, 10)
        }
    }

    return { onUpdate }
}


function movementSystem (world) {
    const onUpdate = function (dt) {
        for (const entity of ECS.getEntities(world, [ 'position', 'moveable' ])) {
            entity.position.x += entity.moveable.dx
            entity.position.y += entity.moveable.dy
        }
    }

    return { onUpdate }
}


function rendererSystem (world) {
    const onUpdate = function (dt) {

        // optional 3rd parameter, can be 'added' or 'removed'. provides the list of entities that were
        // added/removed since the last system call which match the filter
        for (const entity of ECS.getEntities(world, [ 'renderable' ], 'added')) {
            // do whatever setup you need for newly created renderable here
        }

    }

    return { onUpdate }
}


ECS.addSystem(world, keyboardControlSystem)
ECS.addSystem(world, movementSystem)
ECS.addSystem(world, rendererSystem)


let currentTime = performance.now()

function gameLoop () {
    const newTime = performance.now()
    const frameTime = newTime - currentTime  // in milliseconds, e.g. 16.64356
    currentTime = newTime

    // run onUpdate for all added systems
    ECS.update(world, frameTime)

    // necessary cleanup step at the end of each frame loop
    ECS.cleanup(world)

    requestAnimationFrame(gameLoop)
}


// finally start the game loop
gameLoop()
```


### not filter

Sometimes it's useful to query by components that are _not_ present:

```javascript
// get all entities that have a transform component but lack a hero component
const entities = ECS.getEntities(world, [ 'transform', '!hero' ])
```


### deferred component removal

By default, when a component is removed from an entity, it is deferred until the next frame.

This is typically what you want, but if you want to immediately remove a component, you can do this:

```javascript
const componentName = 'aabb'

const world = ECS.createWorld()
const entity = ECS.createEntity(world)
ECS.addComponentToEntity(world, entity, componentName)


const deferredRemoval = false  // by default this is true. setting it to false immediately removes the component
ECS.removeComponentFromEntity(world, entity, componentName, deferredRemoval)

ECS.getEntities(world, [ componentName ]).length  // because we are not deferring the removal, length === 0 
```


### devtools chrome extension

If you'd like to see a real time view of the data in your ECS powered program, there is a dev tools extension!

![alt text](devtools.png "screenshot of the ECS devtools in action")

Assuming you have the `devtools-extension/` unpacked in chrome, you should see this icon appear colored. clicking it will show this popup, indicating the page is using an ecs instance:
